# Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering

## Project Overview

This project focuses on customer segmentation, a common application of unsupervised machine learning. Using the K-Means clustering algorithm, we classify customers into distinct groups based on various features. By identifying different customer segments, businesses can better understand their customer base and develop more targeted marketing strategies.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information about customers and their purchasing behavior. Key attributes include:

- **Customer ID**
- **Gender**
- **Age**
- **Annual Income**
- **Spending Score**

These attributes are used to cluster the customers into distinct segments for better business insights.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- **Customer Segmentation.ipynb**: The main Jupyter notebook containing the full analysis and implementation of the K-Means algorithm for customer segmentation.
- **README.md**: This document that provides an overview of the project.

> **Note**: This notebook has also been uploaded to my [Kaggle profile](https://www.kaggle.com/code/adarshrajmaurya/discovering-customer-segments-with-k-means), where you can explore the code, results, and visualizations in an interactive environment.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**: The data is first cleaned and prepared by handling missing values and scaling features to improve the performance of the clustering algorithm.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizations and summary statistics help understand the data and find patterns that can inform the clustering process.
3. **Clustering with K-Means**: We apply the K-Means algorithm to segment customers into different clusters based on their purchasing behavior.
4. **Cluster Evaluation**: We evaluate the clusters using techniques such as the Elbow Method and Silhouette Score to determine the optimal number of clusters.
5. **Visualization of Results**: The clusters are visualized in two dimensions to better understand the characteristics of each segment.

## Results

After clustering, we identified [X] customer segments. The insights from each segment can help businesses tailor their marketing strategies, optimize customer experience, and improve retention.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Pandas**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Seaborn**
- **Scikit-learn**

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the use of K-Means clustering for customer segmentation. It can be extended to include additional features or other clustering algorithms like DBSCAN or hierarchical clustering for more robust customer insights.
